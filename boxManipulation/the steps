0.    place target close to the functional feature of t shape tool
0.1   
1. Get initial target position and target rotation.
2. get initial tool position and tool rotation
3. apply force on the tool at once. calculate the applied force and applied velocity for tapping.
4. the target object gets manipulated.
5. calculate the target velocity after impact. 
5. calculate the tool velocity after impact.
6. after 5 seconds of motoion, calculate, the target position, target rotation, target velocity, tool position, tool rotation, tool velocity total traversal time.
